        review1: "Adetomiwa takes such pride in each and every detail he does for our cars. Almost weekly now for several years, he comes to our house and takes great care to deliver us a sparling clean, and perfectly detailed car. What is most impressive about Adetomiwa is the way he runs his business. He does what he says he is going to do...each and every time. it's impossible not to reward him and his incredible business with a wholehearted 110% recommendation to others who are in search of quality auto detailing, excellent service, and a trustworthy person/owner in charge of it all.",

        review1: 'I have used several Auto Detailing Companies since moving to Florida 8 years ago, but nobody does the exceptionally high quality work performed by Adetomiwa. The cars look as though they just came off the clear coat paint line at the manufacturer. Jake is fastidious about washing every part of the car, and power drying to ensure no water spots appear from drying. As good as the work manship is, you will not find a better more dedicated individual than Adetomiwa. I would highly recommend Adetomiwa',
